# UltimateCube
# by mistertherobot 

Welcome to the UltimateCube! This guide will help you get started with using the program.
This project is made for fun so go ahead and blast me with feedback!

## Installation
1. Clone or download the UltimateCube repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (refer to the `requirements.txt` file if applicable).
3. Run the program using your preferred method (e.g., double-click the executable or run the main script in your terminal).

## Features
- you can customise the video of cube spinning and its gradient!
check the config.json under scripts file to be able to configure it!

    About config.json:
    1. start_color and end_color are both RGB values you store! (example "[R,G,B], format")
    2. gradient_steps makes the size of gradient and you store it like integer. (example "Value,")
    3. cleanup_txt, cleanup_png and move_output are more for debug purposes, cleanup_txt clears the cache folder for .txt files("frames" and "converted_frames" folders are the txt cache),
    but cleanup_png clears the cache for "images" folder! Move_output all it does is moves output.mp4 (the video you are creating) into "videos" folder.

- you can also modify any file in this project since its open source :)

- videos folder contain already converted from pngs presets

- cogs folder has files that do around with files and moving
- create folder contains file that I solely use for more powerful usage idk

- feel free to modify workflow of code_run.bat!

## How to Use
1. Launch the UltimateCube program. (you can customise the args in config.json)
2. Wait and have fun! (the video is located in videos file)
